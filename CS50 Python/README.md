#### Description:

Welcome to the "Voice Assistant with Wikipedia" project! This project is designed to provide users with an interactive and informative experience through a voice-activated assistant that seamlessly integrates with Wikipedia.

### How to Use

1. **Text Input Scenario:**
   - Users can input their queries using text. Simply type your question when prompted, and the assistant will read out a concise Wikipedia summary of the query.

2. **Voice Dictation Scenario:**
   - Users can dictate their questions using their voice. The assistant utilizes Google Speech Recognition to convert spoken words into text, processes the question, and provides a spoken response with a Wikipedia summary.

3. **Voice Command Scenario:**
   - Users can activate the assistant by saying 'Sam' followed by a command. For example, saying "Sam, what is artificial intelligence?" triggers the assistant to provide a Wikipedia summary of the specified topic.

### Files Overview

- **main.py:**
  - Contains the main control loop (`main()`) that presents the user with scenarios and calls corresponding functions based on their choice.

- **test_project.py:**
  - Includes test cases to ensure the functionality and reliability of the project. Run these tests to validate the behavior of the code.

- **requirements.txt:**
  - Lists the dependencies required to run the project. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages.
